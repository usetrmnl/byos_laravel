## TRMNL BYOS (PHP/Laravel)

[![tests](https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_laravel/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/usetrmnl/byos_laravel/actions/workflows/test.yml)

TRMNL BYOS Laravel is a self-hostable implementation of a TRMNL server, built with Laravel.
It allows you to manage TRMNL devices, generate screens using native plugins, recipes (55+ from the [community catalog](https://bnussbau.github.io/trmnl-recipe-catalog/)), or the API, and can also act as a proxy for the native cloud service (Core). With over 20k downloads and 100+ stars, it’s the most popular community-driven BYOS.

### Hosting

Run everywhere, where Docker is supported: Raspberry Pi, VPS, NAS, Container Cloud Service (Cloud Run, ...).
For production use, generate a new APP_KEY (`php artisan key:generate --show`) and set the environment variable `APP_KEY=`. For personal use, you can disable registration (see section Environment Variables).

#### Docker Compose
Docker Compose file located at: [docker/prod/docker-compose.yml](docker/prod/docker-compose.yml).

##### Backup Database
```sh
docker ps #find container id of byos_laravel container
docker cp {{CONTAINER_ID}}:/var/www/html/database/storage/database.sqlite database_backup.sqlite
```

##### Updating via Docker Compose
```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

#### VPS
If you’re using a VPS (e.g., Hetzner) and prefer an alternative to native Docker, you can install Dokploy and deploy BYOS Laravel using the integrated [Template](https://templates.dokploy.com/?q=trmnl+byos+laravel).
It’s a quick way to get started without having to manually manage Docker setup.

#### Login

If your environment is local, you can access the server at `http://localhost:4567` and login with user / password
`admin@example.com` / `admin@example.com`, otherwise register. With environment variable `REGISTRATION_ENABLED` you can control, if registration is allowed.

### ➕ Add Your TRMNL Device

##### Auto-Join (Local Network)

1. Switch on the “Permit Auto-Join” toggle in the header. For that to work only one user can be registered.
2. New devices on your local network will be detected and added automatically when connecting to the server.

✅ This is the easiest way to connect your devices with minimal effort.

##### Manually

1.	Open the Devices page:
      👉 http://localhost:4567/devices
2.	Click “Add New Device”.
3.	Retrieve your TRMNL MAC Address and API Key:
- You can grab the TRMNL Mac Address and API Key from the TRMNL Dashboard
- Alternatively, debug incoming requests to /api/setup to determine them


### ⚙️ Configure Server for Device

#### 📌 Firmware Version 1.4.6 or Newer

* Setup device
* After entering Wifi credentials, choose "Custom Server"
* Point to the URL of your server

#### Firmware Older Than 1.4.6

If your device firmware is older than 1.4.6, you need to flash a new firmware version to point it to your server.

See this YouTube guide: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xehPW-PCOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xehPW-PCOM)

### ☁️ Activate fresh TRMNL Device with Cloud Proxy

1) Setup the TRMNL as in the official docs with the cloud service (connect one of the plugins to later verify it works)
2) Setup Laravel BYOS, create a user and login
3) In Laravel BYOS in the header bar, activate the toggle "Permit Auto-Join"
4) Press and hold the button on the back of your TRMNL for 5 seconds to reactivate the captive portal (or reflash).
5) Go through the setup process again, in the screen where you provide the Wi-Fi credentials there is also option to set the Server URL. Use the local address of your Laravel BYOS
6) The device should automatically appear in the device list; you can deactivate the "Permit Auto-Join" toggle again.
7) In the devices list, activate the toggle "☁️ Proxy" for your device. (Make sure that the queue worker is active. In the docker image it should be running automatically.)
8) As long as no Laravel BYOS plugin is scheduled, the device will show your cloud plugins.

###### Troubleshooting

Make sure that your device has a Developer license, you should be able to verify by calling the `https://trmnl.app/api/display` endpoint.
